        <div align="justify"> Q magnets can be placed in either of two arrays depending on the intensity of the pain. The first is intended for mild to moderate pain. Feel for the joint spaces or grooves on either side of the kneecap by bending the knee forward and back. Place a Q magnet on either side of the knee in these two joint spaces. </div>

        <div align="justify"> For more intense knee pain, add a Q magnet above and below the knee in the joint spaces, again by feeling for the grooves at the top and bottom of the kneecap, while bending the knee back and forth. Placement should resemble a diamond shape around the kneecap. </div>

        <div align="justify"> In some cases it may also be necessary to treat centrally over the spine. All pain is first interpreted at the spine and the nerves that innovate the knee insert into the spine at L3. L4 is located at the same level as the waist and can be found by imagining a line joining either side, where it crosses the spine is L4. L3 is around 2cm above L4 or you may feel it as the next bony protrusion. Wear a Q magnet over L3 for a few days and monitor your condition, you may need to shift it slightly up or down to ensure you have the correct placement. </div>

          <h3>Note:</h3>
          <br>
          <p>These are recommendations from neurologists and physiotherapists who have used
            Q magnets extensively in a clinical setting. See the <a href="products.php">Q magnets products page</a> for a description of each device, including the sizes and penetration depths. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>It is important  to get the right dose of magnetic field to the target tissue,  otherwise there will be little or no effect. This may require using the information supplied with your order and on this website with a bit of trial and error to achieve the optimal placement. The best results are usually achieved by seeing an appropriately trained health professional such as a doctor or physiotherapist using their own clinical reasoning and neural anatomy to find the most effective placements. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>As a general rule,  the larger  devices such as the <a href="buy-QF28-6.php">QF28-6</a> and <a href="buy-QF28-3.php">QF28-3</a> should be used centrally over the spine and over the larger deeper nerves
            such as the sciatic nerve, the smaller Q magnets such as the <a href="buy-QF20-3.php">QF20-3</a> and <a href="buy-QF15-2.php">QF15-2</a> should be used peripherally over areas such as the elbow and wrist and the smallest models <a href="buy-QF10-2.php">QF10-2</a>, <a href="buy-Q6-15.php">Q6-1.5</a> used on trigger points. With each pain episode, you may require a larger Q
            magnet and as the pain diminishes substitute with a smaller device to maintain your pain free state.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The smaller devices such as the <a href="buy-QF20-2.php">QF20-2</a> have a lower profile, hence 
            may be more comfortable for daily use. The <a href="buy-Q6-15.php">Q6-1.5</a> is very small 
            and only requires a small round plaster to apply it to the body, hence it
            is very comfortable and inconspicuous to wear, but has a shallow penetration and
            a very small active surface area and is unlikely to be effective over the lower back or neck or the larger joints such as the hip, knee, shoulder, ankle and elbow. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The largest Q magnet, the <a href="buy-OF50-3.php">OF50-3</a> has
            the advantage of covering a  larger active
            surface area (the active surface area of the Q magnet is  the boundary line between
            the alternating poles, this is where the magnetic field gradient
            is at its steepest) and penetrates to around 35mm or 1.4'. Whereas the <a href="buy-QF28-6.php">QF28-6</a> and <a href="buy-QF28-3.php">QF28-3</a> models cannot cover two adjacent spinal levels such as L4/5 and L5/S1 since they have to be separated by an inch or 2.5cm, the <a href="buy-OF50-3.php">OF50-3</a> can cover two adjacent levels which can make all the difference if required. </p>

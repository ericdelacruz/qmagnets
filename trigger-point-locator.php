					<p>Active trigger points are a major cause of myofascial pain syndromes. Many doctors and therapists use a trigger point locator and Q magnets as an adjunct in therapy to treat active trigger points. While the larger more powerful and deeper penetrating devices such as the <a href="products.php#QF28-6">QF28-6</a> are needed for nerve pain, often times a smaller inexpensive Q magnet such as the <a href="products.php#QF10-2">QF10-2</a> or <a href="products.php#Q6-1.5">Q6-1.5</a> can effectively treat superficial trigger points. One of the benefits of Q magnets application is that unlike therapies such as dry needling or laser therapy, they can easily be worn 24/7 and provide continuous relief. Read on to see what the research says in this area and how to get the best results.</p>
					<p>By accurately locating myofascial trigger points (MTPs), a consumer or practitioner of neuromagnetic therapy is able to target the affected area with a smaller, more comfortable and affordable Q magnet device without diminishing and sometimes even improving the therapeutic effect. MTPs are a major pain generator in muscular pain and this non-invasive adjunctive therapy can make a significant difference to patient outcomes.</p>
					<h3>The following video shows New Zealand physiotherapist, Doug Edwards briefly describing the how to and why of a trigger point locator: </h3>

					<iframe width="560" height="380" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HNWmfrbaa4k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<h3>THE RESEARCH: </h3>
					<p>Three studies have shown positive effects of multipolar magnets on trigger points:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><p> <a href="#Vallbona">Vallbona et al</a> conducted a controlled trial to investigate the treatment of  chronic pain experienced by post-polio patients with identified painful trigger points with a multipolar magnet and found a significant and prompt relief of pain.</p></li>
						<li><p><a href="#Brown">Brown et al</a> investigated the treatment of chronic pelvic pain with a multipolar magnet applied to abdominal trigger points and at the end of the intervention patients with the active magnet had significantly lower Pain Disability Index.</p></li>
						<li><p><a href="#Smania">Smania et al</a> conducted an RCT comparing the effects of short, medium and long term treatment with repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS), TENS and placebo treatment on myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). The authors concluded that the therapeutic benefits of  rMS lasted much longer than TENS and that rMS may be a novel, non-invasive,         and reliable therapeutic approach for MPS.</p></li>
					</ol>
					<p><a href="#Hazlewood">Hazlewood and Markov</a> discussed the potential of using permanent magnets placed over trigger points but failed to recognise the importance of segmental central sensitization. The persistent pain of MTPs can lead to neuroplastic changes in the spine, leading to secondary hyperalgesia and the amplification of the pain sensation (<a href="http://www.myalgia.com/Treatment/Myofascial%20pain/Understanding%20MPS.htm" target="_blank">REF 1</a>).</p>
					<p>A  number of experienced clinicians have observed that where <a href="#Nijs">central sensitization is diagnosed</a>, targeting the affected spinal segments with the larger Q magnet devices (that have the necessary depth of penetration) will in many cases dampen or &quot;turn off&quot; the sensitization. Where there are two adjacent levels affected such as L4/5 and L5/S1 the octapolar <a href="products.php#OF50-3">OF50-3</a> model can be used. At 50mm in diameter, the <a href="products.php#OF50-3">OF50-3</a> is large enough to cover both levels and also powerful enough to envelope the spinal segments  with a therapeutic field. </p>
					<p>Studies in the past including <a href="magnetic-therapy-relevant-research.php#Collacott" target="_blank">Collacott</a> failed to prove efficacy of the magnetic device because the device was too weak to penetrate to the target tissue, this is now possible with Q magnet therapy. </p>
					
					<h3>THE APPLICATION:</h3>
					<p>Myofascial pain starts with a sudden and sustained muscular contraction in a localised area. This type of pain is focused in areas of MTPs located in one or more of the affected muscles. Active MTPs are painful, quite small (3-5mm in diameter) and highly localised hyperirritable regions with palpable taut bands of skeletal muscle. </p>
					<p>Locating MTPs, even with examination by experienced health practitioners is not always reliable. An objective measure such as a skin resistance measuring device or point locator can be a useful tool to confirm manual diagnosis.</p>
					<p>Skin resistance and its reciprocal, skin conductance, are terms used to identify the skin’s ability to resist or transmit electric current. Pain is a primary factor influencing the skin’s capacity for electricity and specifically decreasing skin resistance. The biochemical changes seen in active MTPs are a result of painful stimuli increasing the rate of blood flow and sweat secretion from sweat glands and ducts. The increased sweat content can account for variations in skin resistance. Several studies have documented the accuracy of skin conductance measurements as a method for identifying acupuncture points (REF 2).</p>
					<p>Acupuncture points (APs) have also been associated with areas of low electrical skin resistance but are mainly located along the body's meridians. There are other points not associated with meridians but there is a <a href="#Melzack">strong correlation between acupuncture points and myofascial trigger points</a>. However, acupuncture points located at trigger points &quot;are not   frequently used by acupuncturists and do not share the same clinical   indications as the trigger point therapy (<a href="#APR">REF 3</a>)&quot;</p>
					<p>There still remains plenty of <a href="#debate">debate</a> regarding the accuracy of skin resistance readings to locate acupuncture points. One of the protocols for using Q magnet therapy is applying the devices using adhesive plasters over MTPs. From the feedback of experienced manual therapists, the use of trigger point locators has proven to be an effective tool to precisely locate hyperactive nerves where the unique field generated by Q magnets have the best physiologic effects. </p>
					
					<p><img src="images/Trigger-point-locator.jpg" alt="Trigger Point Locator" class="imgLeft" />There are number of skin resistance point locators on the market, we recommend the <a href="products.php#TPL">Pointer-Pal</a> as it's reliable and reasonably priced.</p>
					<p>Once the location of the MTPs have been found, then the appropriate Q magnet device can be placed over that point. There are a number of Q magnet sizes for different applications. <a href="products.php">See Q magnet models</a>. </p>
					<p>For instance you can apply the <a href="products.php#QF15-2">QF15-2</a> model which has a 15mm diameter and is 2mm thick. To achieve a greater penetration, select a thicker device such as the <a href="products.php#QF15-3">QF15-3</a> which is 15mm in diameter and 3mm thick.  A  wider diameter magnet will simply cover a larger skin surface  and potentially more nerves,  while the thickness and strength of the magnet is what determines depth of penetration of  the field.</p>

					<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS: By using our current understanding of central sensitization during the clinical assessment of patients with musculoskeletal pain, manual therapists can apply the pure science of nociceptive and pain neurophysiology to the practice of manual therapy. The diagnosis of central sensitization in individual patients with musculoskeletal pain is not straightforward, however manual therapists can use information obtained from the medical diagnosis, history taking of the patient, clinical examination, and the analysis of the treatment response to recognize central sensitization. The outcome of the diagnostic process can be used to determine the appropriate treatment parameters (e.g. intensity and frequency of various manual therapy techniques).

					<br /><br />ABSTRACT: Trigger points associated with myofascial and visceral pains often lie within the areas of referred pain but many are located at a distance from them. Furthermore, brief, intense stimulation of trigger points frequently produces prolonged relief of pain. These properties of trigger points — their widespread distribution and the pain relief produced by stimulating them — resemble those of acupuncture points for the relief of pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between trigger points and acupuncture points for pain on the basis of two criteria: spatial distribution and the associated pain pattern. A remarkably high degree (71%) of correspondence was found. This close correlation suggests that trigger points and acupuncture points for pain, though discovered independently and labeled differently, represent the same phenomenon and can be explained in terms of the same underlying neural mechanisms. The mechanisms that play a role in the genesis of trigger points and possible underlying neural processes are discussed.

					<br /><br />The analogy between trigger points and acupuncture points became widely discussed since Melzack et al.’s landmark study in 1977. There are a number of similarities between the two: the two structures have similar locations; needles are used at both points to treat pain; the pain associated with the local twitch response at trigger points is similar to the de qi sensation; and the referred pain generated by needling trigger points is similar to the purported propagated sensation along the meridians. However, the acupoints located at these trigger points are not frequently used by acupuncturists and do not share the same clinical indications as the trigger point therapy. Trigger points may represent a subset of acupuncture points—specifically, the ah shi points.

					<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that electrical skin resistance at APs can either be lower or higher compared to the surrounding area. The phenomenon is characterized by high short-term and low long-term reproducibility. Therefore, we conclude that APs might possess specific transient electrical properties. However, as the majority of the measured APs did not show a changed ESR, it cannot be concluded from our data that electrical skin resistance measurements can be used for acupuncture point localization or diagnostic/therapeutic purposes.

					<br />My conclusion regarding the findings of Kramer et al. is more guarded than theirs. Before calling a halt to the use of skin resistance measurements for localization of acupuncture points, I propose that we precisely replicate the study design of Becker et al. Until Becker et al.’s outcomes are either confirmed or disproved, the spirited debate as to whether APs have lower skin resistance needs to continue.

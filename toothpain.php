<p><strong>I felt well enough to return to work the next day</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Bradfield Cleveland, Queensland</strong><br />"I first became aware of Quadrapolar magnets in 2003 when my Dentist advised me to have my Wisdom teeth extracted - quite a daunting message for someone who suffers from severe panic attacks concerning dental treatment!! </p>
<p>My Physiotherapist showed me the correct way to use them, and on the day of the Wisdom teeth operation my husband lightly marked my cheeks as to the location of my Wisdom teeth, so that he could apply the magnets whilst I was still in the hospital recovery room. I "wore" the magnets for the next four (4) days - at NO time was it necessary for me to take any other form of pain relief. I did not feel any pain or discomfort, nor did I experience any bleeding, bruising or swelling - I do not know any other person who has had their wisdom teeth extracted to be able to say the same!!! </p>
<p>Apart from the fact that I was "wearing" the magnets on my cheeks, no-one would have known that I had had my teeth taken out - I felt well enough to return to work the next day. I have told other friends about the magnets and they too have used them for pain relief eg broken ribs, adult shingles, migraine headaches - they too have benefited by their use and been appreciative of the fact they did not need to use "chemical" pain relief (which is sometimes very hard on the digestive tract) . </p>
<p><strong>The best part of owning the magnets is that they NEVER wear out (no expiry date), they can be lent to other family members, are not a risk if handled by small children, and only need a brief time to actually start working on the individuals own body - far faster than other commercial painkillers. </strong></p>
<p>It does not matter where I travel in the world, I take "my painkillers" (magnets) with me in my luggage, knowing that I can pass through Customs etc without any problems." </p>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>These are recommendations from neurologists and physiotherapists who have used Q magnets extensively in a clinical setting. See the <a href="products.php">Q magnets products page</a> for a description of each device, including the sizes and penetration depths. </p>
<p>It is important  to get the right dose of magnetic field to the target tissue,  otherwise there will be little or no effect. This may require using the information supplied with your order and on this website with a bit of trial and error to achieve the optimal placement. The best results are usually achieved by seeing an appropriately trained health professional such as a doctor or physiotherapist using their own clinical reasoning and neural anatomy to find the most effective placements. </p>
<p>As a general rule,  the larger  devices such as the <a href="product.php?name=QF28-6">QF28-6</a> and <a href="product.php?name=QF28-3">QF28-3</a> should be used centrally over the spine and over the larger deeper nerves such as the sciatic nerve, the smaller Q magnets such as the <a href="product.php?name=QF20-3">QF20-3</a> and <a href="product.php?name=QF15-2">QF15-2</a> should be used peripherally over areas such as the elbow and wrist and the smallest models <a href="product.php?name=QF10-2">QF10-2</a>, <a href="product.php?name=Q6-15">Q6-1.5</a> used on trigger points. With each pain episode, you may require a larger Q magnet and as the pain diminishes substitute with a smaller device to maintain your pain free state.</p>
<p>The smaller devices such as the <a href="product.php?name=QF20-2">QF20-2</a> have a lower profile, hence may be more comfortable for daily use. The <a href="product.php?name=Q6-15">Q6-1.5</a> is very small and only requires a small round plaster to apply it to the body, hence it is very comfortable and inconspicuous to wear, but has a shallow penetration and a very small active surface area and is unlikely to be effective over the lower back or neck or the larger joints such as the hip, knee, shoulder, ankle and elbow. </p>
<p>The largest Q magnet, the <a href="product.php?name=OF50-3">OF50-3</a> has the advantage of covering a  larger active surface area (the active surface area of the Q magnet is  the boundary line between the alternating poles, this is where the magnetic field gradient is at its steepest) and penetrates to around 35mm or 1.4'. Whereas the <a href="product.php?name=QF28-6">QF28-6</a> and <a href="product.php?name=QF28-3">QF28-3</a> models cannot cover two adjacent spinal levels such as L4/5 and L5/S1 since they have to be separated by an inch or 2.5cm, the <a href="product.php?name=OF50-3">OF50-3</a> can cover two adjacent levels which can make all the difference if required. </p>

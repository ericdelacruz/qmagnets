The TMJ can be identified by feeling in front of the ear with the index finger while opening and closing the mouth. A second device should also be placed over the occiput at the base of the skull which covers C1, see the head pain video for a description of the location of the occiput. The devices should be worn at night and held in place by Q magnet double-stick adhesives and /or tape. For more persistent pain, they can also be worn during the day. One way to attach the Q magnet over the occiput, which is usually in the hair, is to insert it or attach it to a head band.<br><br>

Some of the smaller trigeminal neuralgia support groups such as the Western Australian group have been open minded and actively seek out and investigate new drug free and non-invasive treatments in the interest of their members. Page three of the Western Australian support groups April 2011 Newsletter describes a number of their member's experiences with Q magnets, some of which were very encouraging. The following in an excerpt from page 1 of the December, 2011 Newsletter 192...<br><br>

While some of the feedback from TN sufferers has been remarkable (see below), many Q magnet customers have not had a complete cessation of pain but have been able to lower their medication. There are many forward thinking doctors who are willing to work with their patients with complementary (or non-drug) therapies to reduce medication. Hopefully you have, or can find such a doctor and they can assist you in monitoring your condition and symptoms while you use Q magnet therapy.

<h2>TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA TESTIMONIES:</h2> <br>
Lucretia Diplan is a retired doctor from Maryland in the US, this is her documented experience in using Q magnets to treat her daughters MS-induced trigeminal neuralgia. <br><br>

I ordered the magnets for my 45-year-old daughter who has been suffering from Multiple Sclerosis for 15 years. As part of the nerves demyelination process characteristic of this terrible autoimmune non-curable disease, she developed last year trigeminal neuralgia with excruciating pain firing along the mandibula.  <br><br>

The first placement did not work:  <br>
I applied first the two tiny magnets (MiniQ's) along her jaw, one up next to the ear and the second on the spot where the pain is originating. She kept the magnets on her skin day and night for a full week with no relief whatsoever.  For another 10 days she wore the two medium magnets on the same spots on her jaw as the first ones. No result, not even a slight alleviation. We are strong believers in the therapeutic action of magnetic fields. The neurologist who sees my daughter suggested we try therapeutic magnetic and he gave us your website where we ordered them. Unfortunately they did not work for my daughter although she was so hopeful that they will at least blunt the trigeminal neuralgia.

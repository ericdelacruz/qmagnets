  Joint pain of the shoulder can be treated with Qmagnet devices as shown by placing a device over the joint space in the front and back and on the top part of the arm. Use at least three devices. To find the joint space in front, raise and lower the affected arm while gently pressing in front of the base of the shoulder. Place a Qmagnet device in the space felt in front of the shoulder joint.

            <p align="left">Back Shoulder</p>
            <br>
<div align="justify">
To find the joint space in back, again, raise and lower the affected arm while gently pressing in back of the shoulder. Place a Qmagnet device in the space felt in back of the shoulder joint. To find the joint space on the top part of the arm, raise and lower the affected arm while gently pressing just below the shoulder bone on the top of the arm. Place a Qmagnet device in the space felt just below the shoulder bone.   

<br><br>
A combination of all three devices is recommended.

<p align="left">Acute Shoulder</p>
<br>
<div align="left">
Pain due to overuse and strain may benefit by placement of the device in the area previously described for tension discomfort of the neck as well as placement on areas of the shoulder which are tender or uncomfortable due to overuse and strain. For a common placement for pain and muscle tenderness use a two-device array over the area of muscle tenderness on the back and an additional one in the joint space in the front as described above.

<br><br>
A combination of all three will be most effective for all shoulder pains.

  <h3>Note:</h3>
  <br>
  <p>These are recommendations from neurologists and physiotherapists who have used
    Q magnets extensively in a clinical setting. See the <a href="products.php">Q magnets products page</a> for a description of each device, including the sizes and penetration depths. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is important  to get the right dose of magnetic field to the target tissue,  otherwise there will be little or no effect. This may require using the information supplied with your order and on this website with a bit of trial and error to achieve the optimal placement. The best results are usually achieved by seeing an appropriately trained health professional such as a doctor or physiotherapist using their own clinical reasoning and neural anatomy to find the most effective placements. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>As a general rule,  the larger  devices such as the <a href="buy-QF28-6.php">QF28-6</a> and <a href="buy-QF28-3.php">QF28-3</a> should be used centrally over the spine and over the larger deeper nerves
    such as the sciatic nerve, the smaller Q magnets such as the <a href="buy-QF20-3.php">QF20-3</a> and <a href="buy-QF15-2.php">QF15-2</a> should be used peripherally over areas such as the elbow and wrist and the smallest models <a href="buy-QF10-2.php">QF10-2</a>, <a href="buy-Q6-15.php">Q6-1.5</a> used on trigger points. With each pain episode, you may require a larger Q
    magnet and as the pain diminishes substitute with a smaller device to maintain your pain free state.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The smaller devices such as the <a href="buy-QF20-2.php">QF20-2</a> have a lower profile, hence 
    may be more comfortable for daily use. The <a href="buy-Q6-15.php">Q6-1.5</a> is very small 
    and only requires a small round plaster to apply it to the body, hence it
    is very comfortable and inconspicuous to wear, but has a shallow penetration and
    a very small active surface area and is unlikely to be effective over the lower back or neck or the larger joints such as the hip, knee, shoulder, ankle and elbow. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The largest Q magnet, the <a href="buy-OF50-3.php">OF50-3</a> has
    the advantage of covering a  larger active
    surface area (the active surface area of the Q magnet is  the boundary line between
    the alternating poles, this is where the magnetic field gradient
    is at its steepest) and penetrates to around 35mm or 1.4'. Whereas the <a href="buy-QF28-6.php">QF28-6</a> and <a href="buy-QF28-3.php">QF28-3</a> models cannot cover two adjacent spinal levels such as L4/5 and L5/S1 since they have to be separated by an inch or 2.5cm, the <a href="buy-OF50-3.php">OF50-3</a> can cover two adjacent levels which can make all the difference if required. </p>

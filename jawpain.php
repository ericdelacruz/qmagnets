                <p>Q magnet devices can be placed over each temperomandibular joint. The temperomandibular
                  joint can be identified by feeling in front of the ear with the index finger
                  while opening and closing the mouth. The devices should be worn at night and
                  held in place by Q magnet double-stick adhesives and /or tape.</p>

                <h3>Note:</h3>
                <p>These are recommendations from neurologists and physiotherapists who have used
                  Q magnets extensively in a clinical setting. See the <a href="/products.php">Q magnets products page</a> for a description of each device, including the sizes and penetration depths. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>It is important  to get the right dose of magnetic field to the target tissue,  otherwise there will be little or no effect. This may require using the information supplied with your order and on this website with a bit of trial and error to achieve the optimal placement. The best results are usually achieved by seeing an appropriately trained health professional such as a doctor or physiotherapist using their own clinical reasoning and neural anatomy to find the most effective placements. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As a general rule,  the larger  devices such as the <a href="/buy-QF28-6.php">QF28-6</a> and <a href="/buy-QF28-3.php">QF28-3</a> should be used centrally over the spine and over the larger deeper nerves
                  such as the sciatic nerve, the smaller Q magnets such as the <a href="/buy-QF20-3.php">QF20-3</a> and <a href="/buy-QF15-2.php">QF15-2</a> should be used peripherally over areas such as the elbow and wrist and the smallest models <a href="/buy-QF10-2.php">QF10-2</a>, <a href="/buy-Q6-15.php">Q6-1.5</a> used on trigger points. With each pain episode, you may require a larger Q
                  magnet and as the pain diminishes substitute with a smaller device to maintain your pain free state.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The smaller devices such as the <a href="/buy-QF20-2.php">QF20-2</a> have a lower profile, hence 
                  may be more comfortable for daily use. The <a href="/buy-Q6-15.php">Q6-1.5</a> is very small 
                  and only requires a small round plaster to apply it to the body, hence it
                  is very comfortable and inconspicuous to wear, but has a shallow penetration and
                  a very small active surface area and is unlikely to be effective over the lower back or neck or the larger joints such as the hip, knee, shoulder, ankle and elbow. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The largest Q magnet, the <a href="/buy-OF50-3.php">OF50-3</a> has
                  the advantage of covering a  larger active
                  surface area (the active surface area of the Q magnet is  the boundary line between
                  the alternating poles, this is where the magnetic field gradient
                  is at its steepest) and penetrates to around 35mm or 1.4'. Whereas the <a href="/buy-QF28-6.php">QF28-6</a> and <a href="/buy-QF28-3.php">QF28-3</a> models cannot cover two adjacent spinal levels such as L4/5 and L5/S1 since they have to be separated by an inch or 2.5cm, the <a href="/buy-OF50-3.php">OF50-3</a> can cover two adjacent levels which can make all the difference if required. </p>
